## FAQ

#### Why?

Because I wanted to implement cute bussy realtime data in my discord bot and there was no C# library for this API yet. And I am not processing raw http bodies, it sucks.

#### Can you please add support for .net6/.netstandard/... so I can use it in my old ass project I am too lazy to upgrade?

No (upgrade to .net8).

#### Are you ok?

No, I prefer weebsocket.
